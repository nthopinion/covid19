      "The CDC does not recommend that people who are healthy wear facemasks to protect themselves from respiratory disease, including COVID-19.  They recommend facemasks for people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).  The World Health Organization has released advice on the use of masks in the community in context of the novel coronavirus outbreak in late January 2020. They maintain that medical mask is not required to protect from non-sick persons. Individuals with respiratory symptoms should wear a medical mask and seek medical care. The facemask is only one way for the prevention of respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and we recommend using multiple strategies including avoiding avoiding close contact with people who are sick, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, covering your cough or sneeze with tissue, then throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe, washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. We however recommend keeping up to date with the CDC and WHO for ongoing recommendations regarding facemask. The WHO recommends that suspected cases of COVID-19 be cared for using isolation precautions. In Health Care Facilities, recommendations for individuals with respiratory symptoms should wear a mask throughout the facility unless the individual is isolated in a single room. The health care workers should wear a mask when entering a room where patients are suspected or confirmed of being infected with COVID-19 are admitted and in any situation of care provided to a suspected or confirmed case. The use of N95 certified masks, particulate respirator, are recommended when performing aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation, and bronchoscopy."

      "It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."

    "title": "What are the fundamental concepts behind Traditional Chinese Medicine in the treatment of night blindness?",
    "answers": [
      "According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, vision of the eyes is dependent on the continuous supply of blood from the liver and Yang energy from the spleen.  The blood nourishes the eye and keeps its physical integrity. The Yang energy enables the eye to see things.  In a normal healthy individual, Nature's Yang energy rises during the day; the body's Yang energy also rises following Nature's pattern, which enables eyes to see better because of increased supply of Yang's energy. At night Nature's Yang energy goes down, and the body's Yang energy follows - leading the eyes to see things less clearly at night. Most patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa are deficient in Yang energy. When the body's Yang energy is lowered at night, people with deficient Yang energy will have more difficulty seeing things - leading to night blindness. As the Yang energy continues to decline, the patient's vision will decline resulting in loss of day time vision and eventually blindness. However there are other mechanisms for vision loss in retinitis pigmentosa including liver blood deficiency which results in a secondary decrease in the Yang energy of the spleen. The liver blood deficiency could affect the physical integrity of the eyes, resulting in visual impairment."

    "answers": [
      "Coronaviruses are a group of common viruses.  They are named for the spikes on the surface of the virus oriented in the shape of a crown. Coronaviruses (CoV) primarily cause infections in birds and mammals but, in the last few decades, have demonstrated the capability to cross the species barrier and cause human infections as well. Human coronaraviruses cause respiratory illnesses. Several outbreaks have demonstrated its severity in causing human morbidity and mortality include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, the Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that started in 2012 and is currently still ongoing. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of coronavirus that causes respiratory iullness in people.  Covid-19 was recognized in December 2019 and has rapidly developed into a threat to global health in the current ongoing outbreak. Covid-19 is structurally related to SARS. Although cases were originally reported to be associated with exposure to seafood market in Wuhan, it is now clear from current epidemiologic data that virus spreads through person-to-person transmission. Based on the epidemiology studies from the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China, the median age of the patients was 59 years with the higher morbidity and mortality among the elderly and among those with preexisting conditions.  56% of the patients were male. The estimated rate of death is challenging to obtain but ranges from < 1% to 2%.  It can be considerably lower as the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases given the challenges of diagnosis particularly in the early aspects of the intial ramping-up phase of the health care response to the outbreak. The efficiency of transmission of any respiratory virus is important for containment and mitigation strategies. Original studies have estimated that each Covid-19 infected patient, on average, spreads the infections to an additional two persons. Until this number falls below 1.0, it is likely that the outbreak will continue to spread and has continued to spread to many countries around the world. Recent reports of high titres of virus in the oropharynx early in the course of disease suggests increased infectivity during the period of minimal symptoms."

    "title": "Is there an effective treatment for Retinitis Pigmentosa?",
    "answers": [
      "There is currently no effective treatment for Retinitis Pigmentosa. In the past, many treatments have been empirically tried on Retinitis Pigmentosa with limited success.  These included diet modifications such as restriction food rich in phytannic acid (animal fat and dairy products) and phytol (green leafy vegetables) for Refsum disease; low protein (arginine) diet for gyrate atrophy. Nutritional supplements: vitamin A, vitamin E, B-carotene, vitamin B6, vitamin B complex, essential fatty acids, lutein, digestive enzymes, amino acids, coenzyme Q10. Ultrasound and electrical stimulation has been tried.  Surgical procedures have been tried including cervical sympathectomy, muscle transplants, injection of plancental extracts, fetal neuroretinal cell transplantation, retinal pigment epithelium transplantation. The pharmeutical therapies include steroids, vasodilators, methyl sulfoxide.  Immunotherapy has been tried.  Application of growth factors and cytokines for Retinitis Pigmentosa treatment is still in its experimental stage. Gene therapy may be the answer for the treatment. It will be years before the first clinical trials of these methods are performed on hummans. In contrast, in China, medical researchers have conducted clnical research on the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine on Retinitis Pigmentosa since the 1960. Acupuncture and chinese herbal medicine was used in this research. The research has demonstrated some very positive findings in patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa including improvements in visual acuity, and expansion of the visual field. Results from electroretinogram studies demonstrated increases of amplitude of summed OP and improvements of the 30Hz flicker index response times. An Australian research study has repeatedly demonstrated that acupunture treatment can lead to marked increase of blood velocity in the supratrochlear artery in a RP patient. Although the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine remains to be established with further clinical trials, it is a valuable treatment option to be explored or tried by Retinitis Pigmentosa patients."

      "The first confirmed case of Covid-19 infection in the United States was reported on January 20,2020.  The patient is a 35-year-old man who presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. He had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. He had not spent time at the Huanan seafood market and reported no known contact with ill persons during his travel to China. Together with the urgent care clinician, the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. On January 20, 2020 the CDC confirmed that the patient tested positive for the Covid-19 but real-time reverse-transcriptase-PCR assay.  In coordination with CDC, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observations, with health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet , and airborne precautions with eye protection. The patient's medical history only had hypertriglyceridemia and no other past medical history. The patients hospital course consisted of persistent dru cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting.  From day 2 through 5 of hospitalization, the patient's vital signs remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia.  On day 2, the patient passed loose bowerl movements and reported abdominal discomfort.  Stool samples, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens as well as serum were collected for rRT-PCR which all tested positive for Covid-19 except for the serum which remained negative. The treatment remained largely supportive consisting of acetaminophen and ibuprofen and 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization. Laboratories revealed a slight reduction of white blood cell count, and increase in platelets and creatine kinase. Two chest xrays were taken and the second chest xray on the night of hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of lower lobe pneumonia in the left lung which coincided with a change in clinical status with initiation of supplemental oxygen and antibiotics for hospital acquired antibiotics. On day 6, a fourth chest Xray showed basilar streaky opacities in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical pneumonia. Given the clinical status, clinicians persued compassionate  of an investigational antiviral therapy.  He was treated with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development) on the evening of day 7.  He tolerated the medication without adverse events. Antibiotics were discontinued on day 7. By day 8, the patient's clinical condition improved and his supplemental oxygen was discontinued.  The full genome sequences from the patients oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens were identical to one another and were nearly identical to other available Covid-19 sequences.  "

      "Combined effort from a team of research scientists from various institutes in China first published 10 genomic sequences from nine patients. It was provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV were extremely similar exhibiting more than 99.98% sequence similarity. These sequences were more distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of the SARS-CoV. The research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University."
